# Introduction-to-Basic-Principles-of-Marxism
  In memory of the class I had in 2021Spring.  
  
  The file "I am Leviathan" includes the noted taken down by myself.  
  
  The whole course had little to do with the textbook, on the contrary, the teacher used
  the development of the history of Western philosophy as a vein to talk about the traceability of Marxist thought.
  Overall, it was in-depth and brief, and fascinating. Unfortunately, the teacher has since ceased to teach the course and is now engaged in the study of Marxism, so I would like to take these notes as a tribute.
